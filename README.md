# Algorithm and Data Estructure Activities

Here I got some of the practicing exercixes that I had to do studying when I was having algorithms and data structure classes in the Computer Engeneering course I did years ago.

Each folder store the main.cs file and the program explanation.

All programs here were developed using repl.it, wich is an amazing "web IDE" to develope using almost all programming languages.
